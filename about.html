            <p> Hello, Samarth Sarvade here. Well, I have enrolled for my BTech in
                N. K. Orchid College of Engineering and Technology, Solapur. Basically
                I'm an E&TC student studing in Second Year but, I'm also interested in the software
                field especially into google cloud. . I am proficient in coding and have expertise in languages such as C,
                C++, Java, and Python, with front-end development experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                My interests lie in Cloud and Flutter, and I attended the Google Devfest 2022 in Belgaum to deepen 
                my understanding of these technologies in which flutter, kubernetes
                and Al were the main parameters to understand.. I have also participated in various events by Google, 
                including the Google Cloud Ready Facilitator Program, Google Cloud Practitioners Pathway Program, 
                and Arcade events, to gain hands-on experience in Google Cloud. I am currently serving as the Technical Lead 
                for E-Cell IIT Bombay at our institute and the Energy Swaraj Warrior, where I represented 1500 students on our 
                campus.
            <br>Additionally, I am the Technical Member of the AEXS committee at our institute, where we regularly conduct events. 
                Recently, I led a hackathon with 1000+ participants as part of the E-Sparks 2022 event. My expertise also extends
                to Data Analytics and DevOps, which I have honed through my experience and learning. 
                At present, I would be totaly concentrating on skill improvements in Core Java Programming.
                Recently, I was able to crack AZ-400 Exam which is been conducted by Microsoft Learn, into which
                designing and implementing microsoft devops solutions which I get to learn. While, Microsoft Learn is the best 
                platform to learn about azure, cloud, dynamics, etc. I am fond of Google Cloud Concole too.
            <br>Well, I also complete various badges for e.g. Cloud Engineering is the Path which is the beast away experience into 
                the ferm of cloud. Recently I even attended Google Devfest carried out by techiz og GDG Belgaum. Here, I got a lot
                experience ot boost up my skills into challenging fields such as Flutter, AI & ML, some cloud related grooms as Kubernets, etc.
                Here, at ending I would like to mention that Learing is Infinite, there are inumrous of things 
                to surf on and get to know.. Thankyou..
